Building MiniBPM
================

Just add MiniBpm.h and MiniBpm.cpp (found in the src/ directory here)
to your code project. The code is C++98 standard. MiniBPM uses some
classes from the C++ standard library, but has no other dependencies.

A suite of unit tests is provided using the Boost test
framework. (Note that these test the implementation of the method --
they do not give you any indication of how good the method itself is.)
To run them, run "make" or equivalent in the tests/ directory.
